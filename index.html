        <p>Let's start with a little more about me : </p>

        <p> I am looking for a work study placement in a stimulating environment where my skills and positivity will be put to the benefit of your company.</p>

      <div class="card2" id="why">
        <h2><em>Why you should hire me</em></h2>
        <p>Creative and curious by nature, attentive to new trends and open-minded, I quickly understood the importance of communication and innovation in business strategies.</p>
        <p>Convinced that a good university education is not sufficient, I have trained a lot on my own in this field, through the creation of a company, freelance missions or by getting involved in my school's associations. I am also committed to continuous learning through books, podcasts and online courses.</p>
        <p>Autonomous and a quick learner, I rapidly understand what is expected of me and I know how to make proposals to go even further. Very sociable, I know how to create a positive and dynamic atmosphere around me.</p>
        <p>I am currently a freelance project manager for a company specialised in supporting and helping brands develop on Tiktok, and I am learning to be extremely versatile. I create and manage tailor-made marketing campaigns, from conception to production. I work closely with brands to produce strategies and content, and offer KPI analysis to measure effectiveness.</p>
